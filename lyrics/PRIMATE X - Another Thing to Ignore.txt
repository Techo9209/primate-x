PRIMATE X	

ANOTHER THING TO IGNORE	

Words by: jAPE

That lovely armour that you wear
It suits you well
It suits you well

Will you start leaking if it tears?
I just can't tell
I just can't tell

What your limit is

I'm too busy keeping
What we've built upon
This foundation of sand in order

Carving our laws into the
Bones and Stones 
While making plans and borders

Asking for more
Like we know what's in store
When we open that door
And we're praying for war

Antenna, broadcast, signal, send
We must all attend
It's our old and trusted friend

Will you break before you bend?
We'll find out in the end
We're sure to find out in the end

Where your limit is

If I'm not too busy keeping
What we've built upon
This foundation of sand in order

Carving our laws into the
Bones and Stones 
While making plans and borders

Asking for more
Like we know what's in store
When we open that door
And we're praying for war

It's just another thing to ignore

Flow my tears the policeman said
Wash away the fears that live inside of my head

My head
