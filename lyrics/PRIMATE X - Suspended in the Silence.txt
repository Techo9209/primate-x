PRIMATE X

SUSPENDED IN THE SILENCE

Words by: jAPE

In the middle of this moving crowd
It's hard to judge its size

Running toward this mushroom-cloud
I caught your staring eyes

And I recall that rhythm
That served to guide my footsteps
When hanging on to nothing
Hiding openly

Suspended in the silence

I woke up in this padded cell
With cameras overhead

And all these stains across the grimy walls
They range from brown to red

And I recall that rhythm
That served to guide my footsteps
When hanging on to nothing
Hiding openly

I can't ignore that rhythm
That served to guide my footsteps
When hanging on to nothing
Slowly suddenly I'm...

Suspended in the silence

You can tell, you can choose your hell.
But when you choose your hell, you've got to do it well.

Wait and see if time can break the spell..

But I recall that rhythm
That served to guide my footsteps
When hanging on to nothing
Hiding openly

I can't ignore that rhythm
That served to guide my footsteps
When hanging on to nothing
Slowly suddenly I'm...

Suspended in the silence
