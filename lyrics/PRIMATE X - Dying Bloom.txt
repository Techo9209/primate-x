DYING BLOOM

Words by: jAPE

All these walls you've found around you here
They've sprung up overnight it seems

And you want to point your finger dear
But you built them in your dreams

As you try to look for shelter
Sell whatever can be sold
You stoke the fire with excuses
While you're slowly growing cold

You won't gain a thing from searching
It becomes its own reward

You've never known gravity until you've cut that cord

While we're reaching for illusions
Dance in soft confusion

Echoes in a lightless room

Running toward conclusions
While we drown in soft confusion

Hoping to catch a glimpse of that dying bloom

Dying bloom

So, step into this river here
You said you have something to say

Let go of trepidation and fear
Although you might get swept away

Tearing up the road that leads to what you've left behind
Walking backwards is a sure way to be surprised by what you find

You won't gain a thing from searching
It becomes its own reward

You've never known gravity until you've cut that cord

Reaching for illusions
Dance in soft confusion

Echoes in a lightless room

Running toward conclusions
While we drown in soft confusion

Hoping to catch a glimpse of that dying bloom

Keep on reaching fo your reasons
While you keep on changing like the seasons
