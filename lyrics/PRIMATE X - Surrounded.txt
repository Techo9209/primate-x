PRIMATE X

SURROUNDED

Words by: jAPE

Once upon a story you've forgotten
The sweetest flavour indicated something rotten

Nevermind it's a drop in the ocean
And a bit of sugar helps you down the potion

Come on into my humble abode
I bid you welcome

We're burning books and holding hands
And chewing bubblegum

Wide-open eye
Run your razor down the middle

Nevermind I've heard it said it only hurts a little

'Cause we're surrounded
Dumbfounded
Losing time
Hoping we won't have to make up our minds

I see you staring at the tower at the crossroads
In the end we only want to see just how it explodes

Nevermind it's a drop in the ocean
Rub it on your skin you'll see it feels just like lotion

There ain't no use in you acting so defiant
In the end you'll see what it truly means to face a giant

Make your profit from the hopes of the broken
Still clinging to those promises you've never spoken

But we're surrounded
Dumbfounded
Losing time
Hoping we won't have to make up our minds

We're surrounded
Losing time
Hoping we won't have make up our minds.

Pick a side, pick a side.
It'll help you justify this ride.

Pick a side, pick a side.
It'll help you justify your genocide.

Now we're surrounded
Dumbfounded
Losing time
Hoping we won't have to make up our minds
