PRIMATE X

PLASTIC FANTASY

Words by: jAPE

Your jaded eyes
Will recognise
As you watch your bones flow down that empty road

Even your jaded eyes
Will recognise
You take everything for granted and it shows

And 

You

You know

That it's so plain to see
It's just a plastic fantasy
But I need you too believe
So please don't disappoint me

And it's so plain to see
It's just another plastic fantasy
But I need you to believe
So please don't disappoint me

Please don't disappoint me

Galvanised
By what you despise
Your perfect shell won't make up for the rotten core

Galvanised 
By what you despise
Your perfect shell won't make up for the rotten core

And 

You

You know

That it's so plain to see
It's just a plastic fantasy
But I need you too believe
So please don't disappoint me

And it's so plain to see
It's just another plastic fantasy
But I need you to believe
So please don't disappoint me

Please don't disappoint me

You don't know this could be another fantasy
Making your mind up for yourself is your only key
You don't know this could be another fantasy

And it's so plain to see
It's just a plastic fantasy
But I need you too believe
So please don't disappoint me

And it's so plain to see
It's just another plastic fantasy
But I need you to believe
So please don't disappoint me

Please don't disappoint me
