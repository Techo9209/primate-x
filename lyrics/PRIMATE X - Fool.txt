PRIMATE X

FOOL

Words by: jAPE

I almost failed to perceive
What it was I happened to be
Lucky my imaginary friends are helping me

I climbed an old dead tree
I floated out into the sea

All of a sudden I mistook myself for something free

And it seems like

I did it, did it again

And it seems like

I finally burned a hole through
Some of these old pages and veils I cling to
I come across so desperate to convince you
That these old pages and veils I cling to
Are so much more than just a show

And I was so happy to be
Floating right above the debris
Lucky I didn't have to face my sickness honestly

I climbed an old dead tree
I floated out into the sea

All of a sudden I mistook myself for something free

And it seems like

I d-d-d-d-did it again

And it seems like

I finally burned a hole through
These old pages and veils I cling to
I come across so desperate to convince you
That these old pages and veils I cling to
Are so much more than just a show
