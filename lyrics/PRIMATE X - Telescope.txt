PRIMATE X

TELESCOPE

Words by: jAPE

Under your feet
Giving off heat
The ground is completely covered in machines

And infinite chains
Decaying remains
Sacrifice-burn for the almighty brain

So won't you
Go ahead
And say something clever
If you believe it guards you while you sleep

Go ahead
Say you will never
Abandon everything you swore you'd keep

The drum that you beat
The love that you eat
Come in, take a seat and explain yourself to me

The foes that you've fought
The silence you've bought
I can see that you've taught yourself not to get caught

So won't you
Just go ahead
And say something clever
If you believe it guards you while you sleep

Go ahead
Say you will never
Abandon everything you swore you'd keep

Play your game around the flames
And give yourself a name

Planted feet yet going round in circles all the same

So won't you
Just go ahead
And say something clever
If you believe it guards you while you sleep

Go ahead
Say you will never
Abandon everything you swore you'd keep

Abandon everything you swore you'd keep
If you believe it guards you while you sleep
