Words by: jAPE

What is this I hear?
A message so unclear

Drooling in my ear
It taught me what to fear

Singing

Go
Go too far
With you deep belief in the meaning

It's your turn
To go too far
You might find out if you're dreaming
And if you're laughing or screaming

What is this I see?
Standing over me

Like beautiful disease
That brought me to my knees

Singing

Just go
Go too far
With your deep belief in the meaning

It's your turn
To go too far
You might find out if you're dreaming
And if you're laughing or screaming
