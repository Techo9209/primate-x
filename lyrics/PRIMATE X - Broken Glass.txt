BROKEN GLASS

Words by: jAPE 

Instigator
What are you searching for?
Down there on the floor 
Or out along your shores

Calculator
You're always asking for more
It's like you're keeping score 
It goes "One, two, three, four"

One, two, three, four

Little house-pet
Have you paid your debt?
All sticky and wet 
Awash with your regret

Little piglet
Have you found yours yet?
You're all ready and set 
To make one more pointless bet

So here's that thing that slowly eats you
I can see clearly how it defeats you
Drinking so deep from your broken glass
Your fear is eclipsing the sun shining out of your ass

But this too shall pass
This too shall pass

Time just turns the truth you hide into another lie you're living by
Time just turns the truth you hide into another lie

So here's that thing that slowly eats you
I can see clearly how it defeats you
Drinking so deep from your broken glass 
Your fear is eclipsing the sun shining out of your ass

This too shall pass
