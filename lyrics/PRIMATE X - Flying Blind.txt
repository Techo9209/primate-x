FLYING BLIND

Words by: jAPE
 
It's familiar
It's unheard of
It's a battle you know you will lose

So you pick up the pieces
Strewn on the ground

Building a monument to our delusions

So you can struggle like you mean it when you're already bound

You're flying blind
You're keeping your fingers and mind occupied
You dig a bit deeper and you're bound to find
You don't know 
What it is that still compels you so

It's familiar
It's unheard of
It's a game that was made just for fools

Watching the skyline
With your ear to the wall

Hoping that something might breach your defences

So you can struggle like it matters if you happen to fall 

You're flying blind
You're keeping your fingers and mind occupied
You dig a bit deeper and you're bound to find
You don't know 
what it is that still compels you

Outside you can see the fields are burning
From inside this cage you call home
You tried to break away but now you're learning
You don't know what it is that won't let you let go

All the features of this smoking landscape fade away

Flying flying blind
You're keeping your fingers and mind occupied
You dig a bit deeper and you're bound to find
You don't know 
What it is that still compels you

Outside you can see the fields are burning
From inside this cage you call home
You tried to break away but now you're learning
You don't know what it is that won't let you let go
